				Cornealeus typically only sees black and white when it comes to humans but he is
CRAZY about color. Cornealeus is usually not visible in the flesh but can be spotted in
our day to day lives punishing the bad and rewarding the good. The energy you receive
from him is based on you. Alternatively, when he is visible in the flesh, he is roughly the
size and shape of a 6 foot man. Cornealeus is known for getting extreme amongst
humans which is why he roams the earth alone but every now and then someone will accidentally summon him by doing something grand enough to catch his attention.
