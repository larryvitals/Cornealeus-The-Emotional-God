			<h1>Environment</h1>
			<img src="images/fourseasons.jpg">
			<p>The presence of Cornealeus can be felt in any environment from the hottest desert, to the coldest tundra. He travels alone but is often surrounded by others... Cornealeus hears many different sounds because he is always listening. Cornealeus is forever traveling the earth to look for another human to reward/punish.
